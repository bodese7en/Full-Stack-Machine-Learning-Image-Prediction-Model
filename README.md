# Full-Stack-Machine-Learning-Image-Prediction-Model

#### Description: Welcome to my Full Stack Machine Learning Image Prediction Model repository! This project is a full-stack machine-learning web application that classifies images of footballers using sci-kit-learn libraries. This comprehensive project combines the power of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms with a robust web application to enable accurate and real-time image predictions. You can use this repository to create a model that can classify images in multiple categories, this makes it perfect for a wide range of applications, from object recognition to content filtering.

#### The application is built using Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses a pre-trained machine learning model to classify images of popular footballers into three categories: Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, and Neymar Jr. Flask API The Flask API is the backbone of the project. It serves as the interface between the machine learning model and the web application. It provides the endpoints that receive image data, preprocess it, and pass it to the machine learning model for classification. The API then returns the predicted class and probability scores to the web application. Sci-kit Learn.

#### The scikit-learn model was trained on a dataset of football player images using various machine-learning algorithms such as logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, and decision trees. The best-performing algorithm was then selected and used to create the final model. Web Application The web application is the front end of the project. It allows users to upload images of footballers and receive predictions on which footballer is in the image. The web application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is served using the Flask API. It uses the Dropzone.js library for image uploading and displays the predicted class and probability scores using a table.

## Key Features:
1.	Data Preprocessing Utilities: We offer efficient data preprocessing utilities to handle various image formats, resize images, and perform data augmentation to enhance the model's robustness.
2.	Model Evaluation and Comparison: Comprehensive evaluation scripts allow you to compare the performance of different models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
3.	Web Application: Our full-stack approach includes a user-friendly web application powered by Flask. This application allows users to upload images and receive real-time predictions from the trained models.
4.	Model Export and Deployment: We demonstrate how to export trained models to formats compatible with popular deployment frameworks.
5.	Code Examples and Tutorials: Detailed code examples and tutorials guide you through each step of the development process, making it easy for learners and enthusiasts to follow along.
